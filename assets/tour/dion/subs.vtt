00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:06.920
I showed up at detox and I OD'd on the front door,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.180
because I used drugs that I didn't know

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.060
what they were. I died pretty much on that doorstep to that detox.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.420
My name is Dion, Dion Scott. I'm, I

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:30.480
don't know, just your average Aboriginal guy trying to grow up in

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:43.580
a kind of a colonized world. I was adopted when I was two

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:52.170
years old into a White family, taken from my Aboriginal family and you know

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.600
I grew up not looking like everybody else. I was you know ostracized

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.840
right away just by the way I looked.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.966
As I grew up, I changed it and you know kind of added

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:14.840
to the whole stigma. So while in detox,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.300
right away I saw the nurses looking at me and they

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:31.460
quickly identified that you know I was a large man and and I

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.840
heard them say, they're like, "We don't wanna deal with this guy.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.820
Let's load him up, right?" And I'm like...

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:40.440
And and next thing I know I'm like drooling because I've had too

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.860
much Valium, and I was like this for like four days,

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.520
like I could barely move, and it was absolutely horrible and they're like,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.180
"No, you're fine. You're a big tough guy," and the whole time I

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.840
was in there. And I'm like, "Stop giving me so much meds." And

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.400
they're like, "If you don't take your meds, we'll hold you down and

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.520
give you your meds." I'm like, "What?" Like it was absolutely ridiculous

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.160
the way I was treated while I was in there. And this was

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:12.420
a year ago. Like you know, this wasn't 20 years ago.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.980
This was a year ago and I was like you know being identified

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.580
as a problem as soon as I got in there

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:27.180
because I was larger than everybody else in there. I would definitely say,

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.840
open your heart, open your mind, understand where

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.660
they're coming from and just you know and listen you know listen to

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.160
what they have to say. Maybe close your eyes and listen, if that

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:51.220
helps. Well, I had a very good nurse.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.940
In 2006, I hurt my leg really bad

00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.300
and she was so supportive. She knew I didn't want to be there

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.580
and after I was discharged from the hospital, I actually returned like two

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.220
years in a row dropping off chocolates just there because they treated me

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.560
so well.
