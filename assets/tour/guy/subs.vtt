00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:03.780
Remember why you wanted to get into health

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.200
in the first place? Was it to help others? Was it to improve

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.240
the quality of people's lives? Then don't ever forget that.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.750
People down here, I mean I even had my friends who were substance

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.480
users down here, they came up to me and said, dude, you cannot,

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.940
you have to stop. And you know, they're not talking about them, they're

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.460
talking about me. I was like, dude, please, let go. From '83 to

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.380
'93 I was in and out of the area, but from 1993 to

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.060
2013 I never left a two block radius and really hung out right

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.180
in front of Insight, before it was Insight.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.600
And went through the first dueling public health emergency,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.500
which was the HIV/AIDS crisis in the '90s and also the overdose crisis.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.800
I've lost many friends to HIV/AIDS and many friends to overdose.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.540
Getting me to go to the hospital for bone infections was like,

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.100
I had to be nearly dead to get me there.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.820
And the reality is, is even when I go out there,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.940
I wasn't treated fairly as a person or as an individual.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.940
I was treated as a drug seeking individual. And even with all

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.900
the pain meds, and this is a true story, while I was in

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.780
St. Paul's Hospital and I had the infection

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.480
in my leg, the doctor prescribed me with lots of morphine,

00:01:33.846 --> 00:01:39.160
methadone, breakthroughs, all these medications and I continued to use heroin.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.040
And he approached me one day in my room and said,

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.520
"We give you all these drugs to help and you continue to use

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.260
heroin." And I said, "I'll explain it to you." I said,

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.800
the drugs that you give me help me with the physical pain,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.380
but this drug helps me with the emotional void

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.440
that's in my soul. And he couldn't understand that and he discharged me

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.220
with an active bone infection in my leg, saying that the antibiotics won't

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.920
work because I won't stop using heroin. And

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.200
that to me really showed just how egregious some people are and the

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.820
treatment that substance users get. And it was the main reason of why

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.060
I never went back and was one of the main reasons why CTCT was developed

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.500
in the downtown Eastside. And when I did go to CTCT, they said

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.020
to me, "We don't care that you use drugs.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.180
All we care about is that you're here every four hours to get

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.480
your antibiotics. If you have drugs and you want to use drugs,

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.740
you can use them in your room. We just want to save your

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.960
leg." You believe the lies that you hear everybody say to you in

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.120
your life. Obviously the verbal abuse, I think verbal abuse in my life

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.940
is so crippling as a person is that even if somebody criticized me

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.840
in a way, even somebody gave me a compliment, I felt so

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.800
gross inside, so hard for me to accept that.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.460
I just didn't believe it. And it's because you were often told that

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.700
you were a piece of garbage, not only from your childhood,

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.460
but then you reflect on that from how society treats you.

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.500
And so I carried that. That is a heavy burden for people to

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.320
carry. And at that moment, that was somewhat

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:35.280
released where it made me think, like, maybe there's more to it

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.920
than just what people keep thinking it is.

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.220
Because inside I knew what I was going through and the pain.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.600
I just didn't trust people to talk to.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.607
So what my suggestion would be to somebody who's new to health care

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.000
or working in health care is this. You have to put yourselves

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.120
in people's shoes and to understand, even if your life, imagine if you

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.860
had a job and you had no place to live

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.160
and you had no car and you had no food, but you still

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.680
had a job and you're sleeping in a shelter and now you're hungry

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.360
and you have to go to work. Like put yourself in somebody's shoes.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.300
Just you don't have to put yourself exactly in their shoes.

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.840
But imagine if we eliminated some things out of your life,

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.340
especially your housing. And then or if you're going to school,

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.860
all these things where if you eliminate or put these challenges in your

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.200
life, how would you react to them? How would you respond?

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.620
You have to go to work. It's like, but you have no housing,

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.540
you know, or where are you going to get your next meal?

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.500
What about your belongings? Where are they going to stay?

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.520
And one of the biggest things that I've often remembered throughout my journey

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.840
is this, is I've never forgotten how you made me feel.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.860
And remember that. I'll always remember the ones that treated me good,

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.840
but I'll also always remember the ones that didn't.

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.640
It's funny now when I come down here, people are like,

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.540
oh, I know you're doing good. And I'm like, how so?

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.480
And they're like, I've seen you smile more times in five minutes than I

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.380
did the whole 20 years I knew you. And for my friends,

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.980
that's really how special it is for me because,

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.160
I broke bread with them for decades. And

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.720
we shared a lot of our struggles. And just to have them here

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.580
for me, it's just, it's powerful.
