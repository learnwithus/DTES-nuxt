00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:13.740
People don't see beyond the actual person. What they see is the nationality.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.760
My name is Nina Nolly. That's my First Nations name. That's what I

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.980
was brought up with. My legal name is Nunziata Naccarella, which is Italian.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.640
I'm Kwakiutl. We came from many different places because our family travelled

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.470
where the food was. So it was Smith Inlet, London Harbour, Tukus, Saganba.

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.820
My mom ended up leaving Port Hardy and not going back really at

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:54.220
all because of the things that was going on up there and also

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.180
being in residential school. So it was very difficult for her.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.820
So she never went back and she raised

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.920
me and my three brothers here in Vancouver. It's difficult

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:17.292
'cause I do get looked down on at times for being First Nations.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.740
And sometimes I just end up, well I wasn't brought up that way.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.460
I wish I was at times because now that

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.780
our heritage is making a comeback in our traditional ways,

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.240
I don't even know my language. With my mom,

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.060
going to the hospital and she's not well. The fact that

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.160
because she's First Nations, they just labelled her being as drunk and

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.940
like, oh well, they're just gonna end up going back out and using

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.060
again. Let's get them in and out as quick as possible.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.500
They don't end up really seem to be treating the people.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.480
It was around Mother's Day, just before that I had started working with

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.390
TORO, which is Tenant Overdose Response Organisation or Organizers. One

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.140
day when we were having a meeting, they ended up saying,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.715
"No, well we need some women to do some training at SisterSpace." And I

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:44.880
was like, "I will." I went over there and didn't know what it

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.860
was or anything. And I found out that SisterSpace was a safe injection

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.160
site for women only. And that was a place where I felt

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.940
would be something that would be a great fit for me.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.760
I myself had alcohol and drug addictions in the past

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.360
and I was able to overcome it. And

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.760
I just, I knew what it was like to be

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:23.340
in addictions. I am very proud of the fact that

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.360
after two and a half years, I know the women, I talk to

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:33.080
them. When we do deal with overdoses, all the overdoses that I've heard

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.760
about that are at SisterSpace or at the tent, everybody's been saved because

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.000
we're right there. I look forward to going to work because I get

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.260
to see the women. And when I do get to see the people

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.900
that come in, like the women that come in, I'm able to

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.420
make sure, like okay, they're okay.
