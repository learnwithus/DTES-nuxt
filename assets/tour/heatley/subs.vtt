00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.100
I would say every single person that I've worked with over the almost

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.620
five years I've been down here has been in the position they're in

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.950
because of trauma. Everyone is somebody's brother, sister, parent, child,

00:00:12.065 --> 00:00:17.750
friend, what you know everyone has a relationship to somebody and you know

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.740
the hardest part of my job is when I hear clients talk about

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.040
the stigma they faced in a system that I'm a part of.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.660
For example, even yesterday I was trying to support somebody to the emergency

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.400
room who was really really sick and the words out of his mouth

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.920
were "I can't go until I get a haircut because I'm scared that

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.900
that they're gonna treat me differently because of how I look,

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.480
because I'm homeless and because I use drugs."

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.100
And that broke my heart. People who are severely entrenched in their substance

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.100
use who have unmet health care needs and for a lot of people

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.720
that that usually involves making many interactions in the health care system

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.620
but in a way that's not meaningful to them. So for example they

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.120
might be accessing the emergency room like four or five, six,

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.400
seven days a week, but they're not ever getting their needs met.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.180
Essentially it's like a one stop shop where people can come into

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.870
a health care center and have all their needs met both medically and psychosocially,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.160
so there's you know social work, there's mental health, there's primary

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.140
care, sexual health, addictions, whatever it is that you may need to be

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.040
seen for in a community health setting, you can accomplish all in one

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.960
place. It's not about what my goals are for the client,

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.820
it's about what their goals are for themselves and so you know one

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.120
of the ways that we do that is initially by just building rapport

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.320
with people and sometimes that looks very different for different people.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.140
Like for example I have a client on my caseload that for the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.120
first probably six or seven months of knowing him all I was able

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.880
to get done was his taxes and and that sounds kind of funny,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.460
because I'm a nurse, but that's what he needed at that time in

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.460
order to build trust with me, so that I could support him to

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.380
access the services he needed from there. I think another thing that's really

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.160
important is there's this huge stigma in health care around, it's a term

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.980
that I hate, but people say behavioral patients or difficult patients.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.820
And I don't think that's a real thing, I think that people display

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.700
certain behaviors, because needs are not met, and so

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.100
those types of terms like behavioral and difficult, they put a lot of

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.580
blame on the patient or the client, and they take a lot of

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.800
responsibility off the health care provider. And I think it's really the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:16.100
reverse of that, we need to look at "Are they in pain?

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.680
Are they hungry? Are they feeling scared and feeling like they're not understanding

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.100
what's going on with their care?" And until we can do that like we

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.660
have so far to go as healthcare providers.
