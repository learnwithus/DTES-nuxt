00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.160
We took a walk every day up over top of Soames Hill through

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.200
the bush, sometimes bushwhacking, sometimes on trails. And that was beautiful

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.060
to be able to do that, to be in the forest and to

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:30.360
see the gorgeous trees. Our little cabin that we had had a lovely

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:35.200
view of part of the ocean. And I'm so glad that I spent that

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.880
much time of that year walking in the woods, because the next year

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.460
I couldn't do it anymore and I had no idea that that was

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:49.560
coming on that quickly. Kenn has real pain issues stemming from his hereditary

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.920
spastic paraplegia, which is a rare genetic condition. The nerves in his

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.000
base of the spine are dying and the signals don't get to his

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.740
brain and the signals that do get to his brain are often

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.120
unpleasant. Yes, that's a good way to put it.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.520
We're aiming to get feedback from the local community about their experiences

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.840
with trying to access or accessing what's called Safe Supply currently.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.060
Our own experience in that department has been unbelievably frustrating.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.760
It's not client centered healthcare, it's more like

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.860
oppressive, judgemental... Paternalistic, patriarchal. Yes. I mean they

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.108
bring us our pills every day and that's very generous, but the pills

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:52.340
aren't enough to keep us well. If we

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:02.020
lose our illicit supply, then we get sick, like same as anybody coming

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.710
off of opiates except for... Unfortunately, I had a prescription for hydromorphone

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.260
for 15 years and then that doctor retired

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.760
and so when he retired, there were no doctors taking new patients on

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.400
essential cost at all. He did not stigmatize us, he treated us like human

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:26.900
beings. We had it too good for too long. A new methadone manifesto,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.060
relatively recently, which describes exactly this scenario as the ideal

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.300
scenario for treating opiate dependent people, treat them like any other

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.730
patient. Have them see a doctor, prescribe them their medicine, treat them

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.200
like normal people. Unfortunately when this switch happened and I lost my

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.240
prescription and the doctor went away, the nice doctor,

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.020
then it just happened to be around the time that fentanyl was arriving

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.400
on the illicit scene, except we didn't know that.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:08.630
And we thought we were buying heroin and turned out that not to be heroin

00:03:08.735 --> 00:03:13.500
or some maybe had some heroin but had a whole bunch of fentanyl in it. And

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:21.289
so anyway we've been addicted essentially dependent on fentanyl in our illicit

00:03:21.375 --> 00:03:26.920
supply for... As long as COVID's been happening. Basically when COVID hit...

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.800
That all it was a... Yeah, it was great entry to the pandemic. So

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.420
it's been a rough past few four years or something like that.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.180
My advice would be to listen to the people who are coming to

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:47.680
them for support or for help. To listen to what those people are

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.160
saying, what us, what we are saying we need.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:58.684
As though they are another human being like... As though we're equals, at

00:03:58.684 --> 00:03:59.860
least as though we're equals.
