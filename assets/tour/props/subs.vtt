00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.880
Over the past year, someone who I'd known from the logging industry,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.440
it became public knowledge about his drug use and he ended up losing

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:20.520
his house and access to his children. His addiction really spiralled and

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.080
it got to the point where he ended up having a fatal overdose

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.780
and he just was not able to access help and in the small

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:33.860
town he felt very isolated. Initially I grew up logging with family

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.020
and through that I ended up getting into paramedicine and started working

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.680
for BC Ambulance as a paramedic. I've always had a passion for harm

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.820
reduction which has now led me to become the manager of the overdose

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.180
prevention site in Powell River. Our mission is to try and reduce the

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.020
number of overdoses in town and help create a connection between people

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.960
who use drugs and other health services. A place of welcome for people

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:12.220
to build a sense of community. Most of our clients are long term

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.640
residents of Powell River. Generally, once people come by they feel welcome

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.360
and then becomes a regular visit. Often, a lot of people come by

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.580
daily. One of our biggest problems is trying to

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.400
catch the working class users or people who are casual

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.480
with the small town and they just don't feel comfortable coming to a

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.070
public setting like the overdose prevention site, potentially identifying

00:01:38.113 --> 00:01:41.580
themselves as a drug user. And that's something we haven't really been able

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.360
to solve yet. So a lot of people who use drugs here will

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.460
really try and hide, hide their use, hide that lifestyle and they don't

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.520
seek treatment or help when they need it because of that. Powell River has

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.500
the highest amount of fatal overdoses per capita outside of the downtown

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.180
east side in BCH. It's become a huge problem.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.960
Between both my jobs, we're seeing the consequences,

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.960
far more fatal overdoses on the ambulance now than we used to have

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.580
and just all the associated problems with that.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.020
With the closure of our local mill there's been a lot of lost

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.120
income and lost jobs there. So people are having a hard time making things

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.020
meet, they're much higher stress levels, using more, drinking more

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.080
and just a lot of anguish for families.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.460
A lot of partners are having to leave town

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.980
for camp work or just alternative work while they try and make ends

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.140
meet. So it's added a lot of stress to the community.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.040
Lately, our town's had a huge housing boom which has led to a

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.860
really high increase in the price of rent,

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.560
which is causing a lot more homelessness. People who used to be able

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.160
to be housed just cannot afford to be housed anymore and with that

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.240
has led to more drug use, more of the problems with addiction

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:07.060
and it just seems to be spiraling. I'd like healthcare workers to

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.380
try and take a step back from the moment. I know it's frustrating

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.040
when you see the same clients often and try and approach it as

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.860
a fresh meeting. A lot of our clients won't go to the hospital

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.460
or do everything they can not to because of past experiences of being

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.460
discounted or not treated fairly by the healthcare system.
