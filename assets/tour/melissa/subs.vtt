Melissa, how has stigma impacted your life? Well, I've been through a lot

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.960
of it. It makes me not want to go to the doctor.

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:21.760
I've tried going on the Safe Supply, and I've been taken off.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.540
Now, do I wanna give it another shot?

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.420
I do and I don't. I don't because it's a lot of effort.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.140
Mentally, you have to kind of gear yourself up, ready to go,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.020
right? Get ready for it, and once you start, you want to finish,

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:44.700
right? And I was in the hospital about

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.540
two years ago. I was really sick. I had

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:56.540
pancreatitis from drinking, and I ended up... They found out that I had

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.800
sepsis, as well. So I was in the hospital for

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.630
about a month and a half. I actually had really good care there at St. Paul's.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.823
I even still see one of my nurses walking up and down Hastings, going

00:01:09.823 --> 00:01:14.740
back to her clinic. I always say, "Oh, there's my old nurse." The

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.020
nurse, I would say like, on a daily, they would come in and

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.860
just be happy. It's like a bright light coming in, in the room,

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.680
you know? And I was excited. It was like, "Oh, I wonder what

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.900
nurse I'm going to get today." So it was a good feeling.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.160
Being in the community, getting to know people,

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.520
just sitting and talking with them, it's like, it's not a job.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.340
You know, it makes you feel good just to get to know somebody.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.640
My brother, I said, "Oh, you're a celebrity around here."

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.040
'Cause he knew everybody. He couldn't get from here to Oppenheimer without

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.570
talking to every single person, because that's who he knew, right? You know,

00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:07.540
you saying hi to that one person could save their life.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:10.940
Give some advice. Would you offer to them if they were watching?

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.640
Come talk to us. Come say hi. We're people, too, you know? Don't

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:22.520
be scared or shy. Just come say hi. You'd be amazed.
