00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.800
I actually had the pharmacist tell me once there was an issue with

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.320
payment that if I didn't spend all my money on drugs I'd be

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:22.200
able to afford my medicine. Well, hi, my name is Brian Glaspol, I'm 28.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.460
I'm currently three years clean from a fentanyl addiction.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.140
I was born and raised in Richmond but I've been all over the

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.420
Lower Mainland. Yeah, I actually took up the complaint of that incident

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.720
to the head pharmacist and he was very apologetic. He reassured me that

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.380
he would actually switch his shifts and come in on the weekend to

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.120
be the one dispensing my dose. And even just the act of using

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.140
my name and asking how was I doing, how my day is going,

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.440
what kind of plans I may have had for the weekend or anything

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.180
like that made me feel like a person instead of just another addict

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:09.720
that they had to deal with. I've spent over 13 years using various

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.940
substances, never thought there was any addiction issue.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.360
I carry so much stigma upon myself that I never felt like I

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.480
deserved to get help so I never accessed the health care system.

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.000
And the few times that I have gone and reached out for help

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.780
in the health care system, I've been judged where it made me feel

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.880
unworthy to even be there. Like I was just another problem that the

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.480
health care industry had to deal with. Addicts and people in mental health,

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.380
we carry enough, so much internal stigma with ourselves to begin with that

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.739
it's important that we address that firsthand then we can address how health

00:01:47.817 --> 00:01:50.300
care providers can help decrease stigma as well.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.060
I got involved early in my recovery with the community action team here

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.740
in Richmond and we were creating a sense of belonging.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.000
I've lost so many friends and family and loved ones to substance use,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.560
mental health issues and I know that if stigma wasn't the root cause

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.300
of a lot of the pain and suffering that it would have made

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:24.900
it a lot easier for my loved ones to access health care. I

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.900
hope that the health care providers learn to just treat people as people.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.200
At the end of the day, you're dealing with people, you're not just

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.460
dealing with paperwork. The differences from the downtown east side to Richmond

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.620
is people with substance use problems and mental health seems to hide it

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.820
a lot better. So early in my recovery I got into this work

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.200
of decreasing stigma and creating a sense of belonging for everyone.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.720
I was still early in my recovery phase

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.640
and I wasn't sure if I really wanted to get clean or not

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.540
but finding the groups that I got to be a part of thankfully

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.500
really helped me open my eyes. So that really motivated me to learn

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.280
and educate myself about stigma and how people internalize it and externalize

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.780
it so that way I can better help everyone in decreasing stigma and creating

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.680
a sense of belonging.
