00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.260
Me personally, I feel good because you look down on me,

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:11.449
I know what I'm doing. I know who I'm helping. I'm Brian Alean. I'm a peer

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:18.200
supervisor at Insight. I've been here for the last 18 years.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:24.924
I make sure that everybody's okay. There's no fights, no arguments, everything's

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.540
calm, everybody's living. I make sure that if you're sleeping, I check on

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.580
you every few minutes to see if you're still breathing.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.760
Also, I feed people. I give people coffee and juice. I make sure

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.400
there's no fighting. I keep the place safe.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.340
For many years, I've been a drug addict. I've been clean now for

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.780
the last 15 years, but I've been a drug addict for many,

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.600
many years. And I wanna see that people are getting the help that

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.000
I really didn't get. If you go to, say, fixing sites or ops now, there

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.120
was none of that when I was an addict, so it is nice

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.260
to see the change. But yes, I had to go through the whole

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.340
stigma where people looked down on me instead of now people are looking

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.201
at me. So yeah, sometimes people still look down on me thinking that

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.890
I am a user or just because I'm living in a poor neighborhood. They don't

00:01:18.904 --> 00:01:22.620
know that I work everyday. They don't know me.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.760
One time when I was in the hospital,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.200
a nurse really, really didn't seem to like me because of who I

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.753
am and where I came from. I had a thing in my

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.350
belly to put antibiotics in me, and I stepped on it and it pulled

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.260
out. And she was very angry, very, very angry. I'm not gonna pull

00:01:52.260 --> 00:02:00.400
something out to hurt myself. I was just a child. I went in

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.400
the hospital to have my appendix out. I come from very,

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.403
very bad poverty. So the nurse knew right away by looking at me. And

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.900
she said, "Oh, all he needs is some TLC."

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.620
And that stuck with me all my life, just somebody who wanted to

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.700
help me, who felt good about me. And anytime I can apply it

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.840
in my work, in my day to day life, I apply it. I

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:37.057
help people when I can. I see someone needs some care, I give it to them.

00:02:37.227 --> 00:02:43.317
And my message was to the Vancouver Coastal Health, to the Vancouver City,

00:02:43.422 --> 00:02:49.000
to anybody in Vancouver, start hiring peers. We are people. We do good

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.400
work, and we're needed in the community because a lot of peers don't

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.780
wanna talk to people of authority. They don't wanna talk to police. They

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.240
don't wanna talk to maybe even healthcare workers. They'd rather talk to

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.620
their own who can help them. Maybe I can talk to you for

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:13.341
them. If you wanna engage... Someone in healthcare wanna engage with somebody

00:03:13.341 --> 00:03:17.000
who uses substances, I've seen right away they should just talk to them

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.260
and see exactly where the conversation goes. And you can tell everything

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.840
from there. If you wanna help the person, you'll know right from the

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.820
way they talk. If not, then you'll send them somewhere where they can

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:35.120
get help. I'm really, really proud that I got off the drugs.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:42.590
When I started work in 2003, I was a hardcore drug addict, heroin, cocaine,

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.980
rock for many, many years. I was on my job for three years

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.580
before I stopped. I haven't had nothing since. I'm very proud of that.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.640
And because I am clean, I can help people a whole lot more.
