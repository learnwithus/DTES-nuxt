00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.300
I think a lot of people don't understand that Drinkers Lounge are managed

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.160
alcohol programs in general because they see them as enabling and they see

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.180
that the only way out of alcohol use disorder is complete abstinence.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.360
And I think that's very short sighted and I think that that attitude

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:34.420
has really not served this community well. My name is Michelle Wishart.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.600
I work for PHS Community Services Society, specifically at the Drinkers

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.800
Lounge drop in, which houses a community managed alcohol program in the

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:50.057
downtown Eastside of Vancouver. So the Drinkers Lounge, we have a brew co

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.520
op where members of the lounge actually brew their own beer and wine.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.220
This gives them not only an opportunity, first of all, to have low

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.220
cost alcohol, but also to engage in the process of learning how to

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:10.000
brew, have pride in that work, something to sort of strive for or work

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.620
towards. I love working at Drinkers Lounge. It is so

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.240
fun. It is just a blast. We have

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.740
so many hard times, we have so much trauma, we have

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.920
a lot of conflict, a lot of... We've lost a lot of people

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.600
and despite all of that, there is a lot of joy.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.220
Drinkers aren't often thought of when you think about harm reduction because

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.880
alcohol is legal and there's just sort of like a different sort of

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.900
attitude about it. But unfortunately, when folks are living perhaps in poverty

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.080
or have severe alcohol use disorder and a very high dependence, they will

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.020
have to resort to things like drinking non beverage alcohol,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:00.740
rubbing alcohol, hand sanitiser, Listerine, and also are very at risk of

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.520
severe withdrawals. Alcohol withdrawals are so dangerous that there's...

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.640
You need to be medically supervised to withdraw from alcohol or you could

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.000
have a seizure, you could die. So people can be part of the

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.900
brew co op and access that alcohol at very low cost.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.820
But there's also folks who do drink illicit alcohol like rubbing alcohol,

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.380
can trade in their rubbing alcohol for safer

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.500
wine or beer. We've had people who've had to go to the hospital

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.220
once or twice a day before they joined our program. And

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.080
once they've stabilized on those programs, those visits decrease immediately.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.700
People will actually be able to think about going to detox,

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.040
whether or not they're ready for a full recovery.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.580
Also, if people aren't stealing alcohol, there's less police interventions

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:57.160
needed, less trauma for the people, less loss for the stores that are

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.060
trying to make a living. So once you can

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.560
sort of relieve that for people, it just opens up so much space

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.400
for them to deal with their grief, to connect in meaningful ways,

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.915
to do things like make doctor's appointments, to do things like get housing

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.500
and keep their housing, to have someone they can talk to when they're

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.520
angry. About 80% of our membership is Indigenous and I don't think there

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.260
is a group that is more stigmatised against than Indigenous drinkers.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.980
It's really unfortunate. And on a whole, Indigenous people in Canada actually

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:41.280
drink less on average than upper class White people, but because

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.720
the upper class gets to stay in their homes and has access to

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.100
great healthcare and nutrition, they're not really seen as an issue,

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:54.870
it's somebody who's sitting on the street drinking rubbing alcohol or Listerine.

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.380
A lot of these folks have a lot of trauma with the medical

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.640
system where maybe they've been ignored or mistreated and maybe at worst

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.600
they've been actually abused. I can see somebody

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.040
turn on a dime if they go up to someone angry and that

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:19.260
person accepts them with grace and humour and compassion. You just soften

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.580
them right up. And it's just... It's all you need to do really.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.000
It's not complicated and it's harder to fight it and you're gonna be

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.520
more tired if you fight it. It's a lot easier for you and

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.000
a lot easier for everyone if you have a sense of humour and

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.420
go with the flow. And obviously, we're all gonna have days where we're

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.400
just fed up and have had enough, but

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.880
for the most part, these are the best people you're ever gonna meet

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.340
and you're doing yourself as well as them just a great disservice if

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.760
you don't keep that in mind.
