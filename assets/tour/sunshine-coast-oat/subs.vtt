00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.180
Almost every single person that has a substance use issue

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:14.500
has been traumatized emotionally or physically at some time in their life.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.460
Usually it's stemming from childhood, but it can also happen from PTSD.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.200
It can happen from violence against women. It can happen

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:34.050
for other types of violence, as well. Our clients on the Sunshine Coast,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.640
Lower Sunshine Coast, Sechelt, Gibsons, Madeira Park, are from all walks

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.720
of life. We have people that are homeless,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.780
sadly. We have people that are functioning perfectly well in society,

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.500
holding highly responsible jobs. It goes through all walks of life.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.780
And, of course, the people that are functioning well in the community are

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.440
on opioid agonist treatment, which makes it possible for them to have their

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.580
needs met and to have a normal "life."

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.180
The stigma impacts clients in many different ways.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:28.760
It can be through the emergency room where their needs aren't met,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.880
often because the emergency room is so busy and

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.000
it's very complicated to deal with the persons using substances.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.020
What I would like to see to reduce the stigma is

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.900
more understanding. Understanding leads to empathy, in my view, and empathy

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.520
leads to reduction of stigma. So often people

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.860
feel that people who're using substances can just stop what they're doing.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:07.580
Why not quit? This is often asked. This is an incredibly complicated area.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.140
The changes that happen in the brain are deep seated. Not in the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.680
cerebrum, the conscious area of the brain, but deep seated in the

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.420
brain stem, diencephalon. And that's not accessible when

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.360
some trigger happens with these patients. They respond

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.040
with a fight or flight response that's ingrained in their brain because

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.180
of what they've dealt with in the previous years.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.640
I think we have to develop trust. It's not going to happen right

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.340
away. That we actually do something to help them

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.500
and go the extra mile. If they need a form for something,

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:03.940
go and help them do the form. It shows them that we're actually

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.640
there for them, that we're trying to help and we will continue to

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.240
help them. It's a matter of building trust

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.820
by showing care is what I believe.
