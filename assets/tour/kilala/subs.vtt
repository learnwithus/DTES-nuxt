00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.580
A lot of them don't have grandmas and grandpas of their own,

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:14.660
so I'm kind of a surrogate grandma, auntie. Differentiate yourself from

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.160
what people expect the system to be like.

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.340
And that means going above and beyond. And it starts with that very

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.920
first visit when someone connects with you. My role is

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.800
to do one to one with members that come in that

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.480
would like to speak with an elder. I usually

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.230
ask them if they would like prayers, to be cleansed with a smudge

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.940
or cedar. I was told by a very wise person whose opinion

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.840
I respect is that by and large it will take three to five

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.100
years for you to win the trust of most Indigenous people because of

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.060
the background of what their previous experience with the healthcare system

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:11.380
has been like. Stigma. Yeah. At Kilala, we don't hold judgment.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.100
And anyone who walks through that door is treated with respect and kindness.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.340
In my 20 year career as a family doctor, I can see the

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.140
difference. When you consistently show up and treat people

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.720
with respect and dignity and they do not experience discrimination, and

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.780
again, they're coming in expecting to be discriminated against.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.200
That is the norm, sadly. Because anywhere else

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.060
that they have been during their life journey

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:55.460
has been full of judgment and labelling. And to get someone's trust,

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.240
it's multiple acts of kindness and respect, and it's across the whole system.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.820
So having a place that's respectful, myself acknowledging just that

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.920
I'm from a settler family, is part of my introduction.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.220
They come in seeking help because they couldn't get it anywhere else because

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.340
of the way they were treated and looked at.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.320
Asking things about people's family, their culture, getting to know them

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.220
as a person are all things that you need to do.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.800
We know we need to do that to provide good medical care.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.200
When they come here, they are reconnected with their culture, either through

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:39.000
visiting with me, you know, doing smudging and prayers with them,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:48.160
or joining a circle in the Hummingbird Room. The investment in the relationship

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.783
is paramount 'cause in this if people don't trust you, they're not going

00:02:52.805 --> 00:02:55.284
to share their information with you and then you can't make good decisions.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:03.500
It would be good for VCH staff to get an understanding of the

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.400
people that come to them for treatment and care,

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.060
to know where they come from and who they are

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:21.900
and why they are here. If I'm having that first encounter and I

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.840
know this is probably a one off meeting, I'm going to take extra

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.460
time with that person. I am going to do a proper introduction,

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.140
make sure that I introduce myself. I am going to make sure I

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:46.160
do shared informed decision making to the best possible level that I can.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.840
Again, we know it takes a bit more time, but we know it

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.400
has better outcomes. I'm going to make sure

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.320
I explain things so that people take enough time and detail.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:59.480
I know this is hard in a busy emergency, and I worked at a emergency for

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.360
a long time. When they walk through that door,

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:06.480
you have a kind word or a smile,

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.620
even just a hello and a first name.

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.900
It just brings them up and just know

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:22.660
that they're not there because they want to be. They don't do drugs

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.260
because they say, I've got to do this, I've got to do that. No,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.940
they don't do that. There's something in their past life.

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:34.960
It's just best to understand. Your marker of success

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.520
above anything else that you're supposed to do in that clinical encounter

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.180
is that they choose to come back and see you again.
