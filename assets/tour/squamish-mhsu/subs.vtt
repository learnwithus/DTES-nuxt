I've seen sometimes some stigmatizing sort of language

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.910
in the hospital when I would bring someone in and they,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.200
in my mind, quite clearly need medical help,

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.280
but because the medical needs have been caused by substance use that there's

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:29.020
some eye rolling or, "Oh, here they are again."

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:37.140
A typical day for the Intensive Case Management Team is we work closely

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.900
with the Opiate Agonist Therapy Team and the Overdose Outreach Team.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.740
We have a meeting in the morning, and we're all trying to help

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:52.500
our clients reach their best potential. So we do a lot of appointment

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.640
reminders, bring people to their appointments, make sure they get their

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.660
medications. We work around a Harm Reduction Model where

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.920
we're not trying to prevent the drug use; we're trying to make their drug

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:14.640
use be more safely used. I mean, I personally think that

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.240
there should be prescription fentanyl. People that use substances, it's

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.400
a human like condition, and it's been with us

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.860
since humans have been around, and it's not going away.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.880
Sometimes a doctor or the housing provider will have some concerns about

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.020
somebody and we can go out and assess them, and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.400
try and decide what needs they have and which service will suit them

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.960
the best. A lot of our clients need different things on different days

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:58.640
and, yeah, just listen and respond to what their requests are.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.700
I find that some of the stigma affects our clients. They're less

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.640
willing to seek out help when they need it. Going to the hospital

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.840
isn't always a positive experience for them, and

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.750
involves some shame and guilt about their lives.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.140
To know that could be a history this person's coming with,

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.460
and be extra gentle with them. And I don't fire a bunch of

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.360
questions at somebody all at once. We might do our intake process over

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.480
several meetings. The person doesn't know me and I start asking them about

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.640
their substance use or their... What is their financial income?

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.380
So definitely taking some time and trying to be helpful whatever that may

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:05.060
be, a ride to somewhere or providing some dry socks. So you're trying

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.400
to lay out some breadcrumbs for them to

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.760
engage with us, and some food works. It's very seemingly simple on the

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.620
outside, but it can mean so much to people.
