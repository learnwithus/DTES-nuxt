00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:13.260
I was raised with trauma in our family. My grandmother had a stroke

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.080
after her daughter was murdered. After that she was moved into a boarding

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:27.360
home for people with mental health illnesses. I was approached through

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.960
the ICM workers in Powell River and learned quite a bit about

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.780
what things were being offered that we hadn't had in Powell River. I've

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:42.200
been able to connect with these people as far as

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.520
learning more about addiction and work along with everyone here,

00:00:48.720 --> 00:01:11.060
for me to just cope. I think people in Powell River are afraid

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:17.700
of the way of life and they think, they're not recognizing

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.500
substance use disorder as an actual mental health and addiction. Learning

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:31.740
a lot about my addiction, getting some counselling and

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:40.680
work and offering my two bits as far as how to help

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.550
in a town. Trying to fight the addiction piece. People I guess being treated

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.220
better and still people treated... Thought that they are strong enough to

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.400
be able to, and be patient. Don't stop working and fighting at what

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.220
you want. Do you know what I mean?

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.250
There are places, there are things to do and

00:02:10.276 --> 00:02:19.040
things not to do there, what you need

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.760
to be housed and to feel happy. You're going to have

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.180
this mental health issue or drug issue for a while.
