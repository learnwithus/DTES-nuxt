Oh, hi. My name is Sara. I've been working in the Downtown Eastside, specifically

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.960
in this organization for 18 years. My role is, I'm right now I'm

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:29.000
running the drop in space, which is a managed drop in. So the

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.300
people who use our space are women who live and work in the

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.200
Downtown Eastside. Among them we have lots of women who suffer mental illness,

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:51.290
addiction, poverty, and homelessness, and abuse, for sure. We are a basic

00:00:51.360 --> 00:01:00.390
service providers. We provide as resources and also we do referrals.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.020
We have free showers, free bathrooms, phones, clothing.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.680
We provide lunches every day, breakfast and snacks,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.960
coffee. And also we have a housing program, a victim service program,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.740
a Chinese outreach program, to name a few.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.760
I'll be right there because I need to see Sandy first,

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:33.980
too. Okay. And I bet I need help. She's not gonna be in. Yes. I

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:43.560
think when women try to find help, they are a little bit resistant to

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.440
look for help because once they... Even for help anywhere,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.520
like say for healthcare, if they go to a store, they are followed. As

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.360
soon as they show that they have mental health or addictions, they are treated

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:18.680
differently than the rest of the population. They cannot go not too many

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.840
places where they feel safe and accepted.
