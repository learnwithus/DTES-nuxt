00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.980
There's a lot of indigenous people here on the Downtown Eastside in a

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:12.960
lot of pain. And I for myself never really had self worth until

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:28.620
I started learning how to sing. Welcome, everyone. My name is.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.560
My corporation or my colonial name is Cody Hunt. I come from the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.520
Kwagiulth First Nation in Fort Rupert, BC. And I'm one of the leaders

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.740
at Culture Saves Lives here on the Downtown Eastside of Vancouver. Culture

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:55.320
Saves Lives is a program that focuses on bringing culture into stigmatized

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.200
areas. A lot of the indigenous people down here haven't had access to

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.440
culture in their lifetime. And we do our absolute best to bring that

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.140
in any facet we can. And the biggest part about Culture Saves Lives

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:20.140
is we always meet people where they're at. The effects of colonialism are

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.520
felt all across Canada, all across North America and all across the world.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.420
But in BC specifically you can really feel those amplified in the Downtown

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:37.060
Eastside of Vancouver. Part of the reason for that is, is through colonialism,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.380
through residential school, the 60s scoop and all sorts of things that go

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.870
along with that. Indigenous people have been displaced,

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.700
whether that has been consensual or not, meaning whether they've been forced

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.080
to run away or maybe they're running away from something at home that

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:03.620
they're not ready to face. And we just do our best to bring

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.660
culture to people that have been deprived of that their whole lives.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.420
And it's not always true, there are a lot of people down here

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:17.020
that do hold knowledge. But the good majority of them have been deprived

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.240
of that. And I strongly believe that that is

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.240
a big piece as to why they're struggling so much with their trauma.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.560
We're an outreach team as well as, I guess, a bit of a

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.140
cultural centre. With COVID, we're just starting back up to run workshops

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.560
again. So on Tuesdays we have Cedar Weaving with

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.860
Tiger, on Wednesdays we have Beating with Candice, and on Thursdays we're

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.660
doing a KwakÊ¼wala language class with Robert Williams, which is very exciting.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.340
So those happen from 12:00 to 2:00, but

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.240
on a normal day we just go out on the street,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.240
sing, or we'll open our doors in here and invite people in to

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.278
join us. I would be more than willing to say that stigma affects

00:03:01.328 --> 00:03:05.465
absolutely everybody on the Downtown Eastside when accessing services. I'm

00:03:05.591 --> 00:03:09.940
confident in saying that 100% of Indigenous people,

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.540
it doesn't matter the situation that they're in in life,

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.700
all Indigenous people face stigma in the healthcare system. And

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.590
a lot of times Indigenous people or people in the Downtown Eastside just

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.320
will avoid helping themselves because of the anxiety of

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:41.580
the experiences that they've had in the past. Anybody that I've interacted

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.500
with in the healthcare system that has been a positive experience has always

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.820
had compassion. A lot of the people in the healthcare system just can't

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:52.960
fathom the other person's position or what it actually means to be in

00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:00.240
those shoes. And so that disconnect there creates a level of ignorance and

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.960
stigma that can be very overwhelming and is a massive barrier for people

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.080
to get the help that they need.
