00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.440
We had a patient that came in. She didn't recognize me,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:09.260
but she said, "I know you're from Dart." And I said,

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.120
"Oh, oh yeah? How do you know that?" And she goes,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.140
"Because you don't talk to me like I'm

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.400
mentally challenged. You talk to me like I'm a person."

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.500
And that really struck me. We really take a lot of our time in

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.660
our day to build rapport with not only our patients, but our colleagues.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.500
And we... We model. We model. We model that ourselves. I think that's

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.020
a huge one, is how we talk, that our colleagues pick up on.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.380
Even using saying, how would that be if that was your family member?

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.660
When we can work that into a conversation, I think that's a way

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.060
that people can accept that. So I would say most of our patients

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.340
have had previous negative experiences in health care prior to coming to

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.080
hospital. And people bring that with them when they come in for care

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.240
next. And they expect to be treated poorly and labeled a lot of

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.460
the time. We always start with a substance use assessment. And then from

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.300
there, we talk to patients about their goals and related to their substance

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.800
use and provide support as people wish around that.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.580
And help manage withdrawal while patients are in emergency and in hospital.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.300
And that's really important, because it allows patients to stay to complete

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:31.600
their treatment for the medical condition that brought them in. Another

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.340
important thing that we do is we talk with patients about

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.700
harm reduction and safer use strategies, as well as provide sterile supplies

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.680
and take home naloxone and fentanyl test strips. So some health care workers

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.980
may be uncomfortable or lack knowledge in how to help people that

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.880
use substances. And as the Dart team, we're there to support and educate.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:07.960
And we try to really keep an open, safe space for nurses and

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:17.160
doctors to come up to us. I had one experience recently with a patient.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.560
What he really needed, I discovered through listening and holding space

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.320
for that discussion, was to be heard, to have someone listen to his

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.780
concerns and acknowledge how difficult that would be to have a lack of

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.000
power in a health care setting. When people come into the ER,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.280
it may be the worst day of their lives.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.440
And some of the people that do come in, they have...

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.680
Their social determinants of health aren't acknowledged. And

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.680
I think our takeaway is to just always be kind

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.780
and to really meet people where they're at and to listen

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.340
and to provide a safe place for people to come and get their

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:08.360
health care needs met.
