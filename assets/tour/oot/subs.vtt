00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.190
My name is Jeff Woodyard. I'm an outreach worker with the Overdose Outreach

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.040
team based out of Vancouver. The team is primarily focused on helping folks

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.460
navigate the healthcare system. We work primarily with folks that either

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.380
have experienced an opioid overdose or are at high risk of one.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.180
And currently with the fentanyl crisis, that's basically anybody that uses

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.540
anything harder than marijuana or mushrooms. We're very client driven, so

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.940
we respond and work with the clients on what they want to work

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.660
with. I would say the majority of our work is helping connect folks

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.020
to primary care, which is a significant challenge for anybody in the city

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.450
of Vancouver. As well as connecting to clinics that offer opioid replacement

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.420
therapy, so that can be Suboxone, Methadone, Kadian. Also doing treatment

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.760
referrals, detox referrals, it can help people get up on income assistance

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.500
if they aren't. We have several social workers in our team

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.140
that do PWD applications. And then connecting to other services in the community

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.260
as well. We outreach people in the community, engage them where they're

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.640
at, and help them with what they want to work on and whatever that

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.660
looks like. Anyone can refer to our team, anyone can access our services.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.140
There's no sort of, outside of the substance use, there's no

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:22.680
limitation on who can access our services. We're not just on the Downtown

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.600
Eastside, but the majority of our clients are... There's just greater health

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.540
needs down here. The team was created in response to the overdose crisis.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.020
It originally started with one guy who's still on our team.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.380
And then we're now expanded up to at least 15 people in Vancouver

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.960
alone, and there's teams across the region. You hear the name and I

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.380
think people get the assumption that our team is responding in the moment

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.200
to overdoses, and that certainly doesn't happen. But basically

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.120
what we're trying to do is connect folks to health care so that

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.460
a clinic, once they have a relationship with a health care provider,

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.360
you can see that the likelihood of an overdose starts to drop if

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.900
they get on opioid replacement therapy or if they're on Safe Supply,

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.220
or even just taking care of things like infections and colds and flu

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.820
and all the sort of stuff that can come.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.080
So I'm starting my week today, and I came into four voicemails from

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.366
the same client. The first which was just screaming at me,

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.000
and they progressively got a little less intense because I know this client

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.900
and I know their behaviour, and I know that they're dealing with incredible

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.460
long term years of chronic pain, and when it's really bad,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.980
they are not in a very good space.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.820
And so I don't take those moments personally because

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.100
I can't imagine what it's like to live with an open wound for

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.360
over a year. I don't know what that's like,

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.920
but I do know through my own medical history and things that I've

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.280
gone through, what it's like to live with massive amounts of physical pain

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.840
and how in that moment all you want is the pain to go

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.600
away. My favourite thing about my job to be honest is just like

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.240
if I'm driving a client somewhere and we just start chatting and talking

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.560
about, for me it's usually sports or music,

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.700
and just having these normalising behaviours and to build a relationship

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.640
and build rapport. I got a call from a client this morning who

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.180
two months ago, our last interaction was him basically, I want nothing to

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.920
do with anything to do with the healthcare system, leave me alone,

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.580
and there was a lot more explicitives in that.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.680
And today he got a random phone call, he held onto my card

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.540
and asked for support getting onto disability, which will involve getting

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.760
him connected to primary care, which he was completely against,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.180
and all these kind of things. And so

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.240
for better or for worse, in that moment two months ago he was

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.140
very angry with me and with the system and stuff, but there was

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.180
something about our interactions where he saw me as a safe person that

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.020
down the road he could reach out to. And so now

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.740
I'm filling out referral forms and starting to build that relationship.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:52.540
I think once you kind of get past that initial fear,

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:01.880
there is an incredible, incredible community of people and are really, really

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:05.220
have a heart for looking out for each other. You can see actually

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.600
what is going on down here and how much these folks matter to

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.820
each other and to me.
