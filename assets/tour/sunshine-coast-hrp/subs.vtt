00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:11.140
People are so often pushed from one agency to the next agency to

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.900
the next, and it can seem like the buck never stops.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.740
And it's really important that we recognize that. And when it comes in

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.800
front of us, in front of our desk, to my vehicle,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:34.520
that we don't do that same thing. Our Sunshine Coast Harm Reduction program

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.800
is, in my opinion, a fairly historic program in British Columbia.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.800
Our community is what we describe as a ribbon community. Our highway is

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.880
85 kilometers long and we have a number of communities spread out along

00:00:51.880 --> 00:01:01.040
that highway. So from early on, we determined that we needed to offer

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:05.740
a mobile harm reduction program so that we could meet people where they're

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.520
at, not require people to meet us at our office,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.220
not require people to necessarily get in a vehicle and come meet us

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:22.940
somewhere as well. We have individuals from all financial backgrounds, from

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.480
all walks of life, from every type of family makeup you can imagine,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.860
seeking supports. We have people that would never present as somebody struggling

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.720
with addiction or substance use issues. And we have individuals that everybody

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.220
assumes they know what all their problems are.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:51.980
It's our job to meet everybody where they're at and to be as

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.700
open and welcoming as possible, no matter what their background, no matter

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:02.700
what level of service they're seeking. I have the best clients I could

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.580
ever ask for. My clients are so amazingly interesting and diverse.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.560
I'm never, ever bored. People will call me and

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.320
we make arrangements to meet at their home, in the community,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.760
at my office, wherever they decide to meet.

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.420
We know that we need to strive to be as client centered as

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.180
possible and we find this really puts a lot of the power into

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.340
our clients' hands from the very beginning of our conversations. They get

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.800
to dictate where we're meeting and how that meeting goes.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.280
So, my car is full of harm reduction equipment, we offer

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.720
safe injection equipment, safer smoking equipment, I have safer sex

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.860
gear in my car as well as Naloxone. I try to have everything

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.360
that I need that people might require from me out there.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.360
Our goal is to reduce stigma, to lower the barriers for our clients

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:26.040
to seek supports and service healthcare. We know that the stigma

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.040
that people, individuals are facing is preventing them from seeking attention

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.060
at the hospital, seeking attention from their healthcare provider. So, we

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.780
are trying to be as aware as possible of that and to lower

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:50.750
the stigma and the barriers to our program. I would like other healthcare

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.380
workers to know that when a person sits in front of you,

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.600
a person who might use substances, a person who might be struggling,

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.180
I'd like you to know that that could be your brother or your

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.080
sister or your father or your child, that

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:18.660
that could be you or me. Sometimes, enough circumstances will go the wrong

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.220
way that will just tip the balance against us and

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:31.775
lead us into an area where we start struggling. And to understand that

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.560
the individual in front of you is shaming themselves already

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.020
so much it's damaging their health. We need to

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:47.680
reduce any stigma from our end to help support that person accessing

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.200
better health or healthcare or whatever they're attempting to do.
