WEBVTT

00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.660
We can stigmatize or have stereotypes of other people when we don't

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.460
recognize some of what they've been through and how they need a little

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.700
bit of a break and they need an open mind.

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.400
We are a team of nurse practitioners, family physicians,

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.460
RNs, social workers, social service liaison, and very importantly

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.700
front desk administrative staff who are really our glue. A big piece of

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:33.960
the mission at our clinic is tied to Vancouver Coastal Health's values,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.980
which are we care for everyone, we're always learning, and we strive for

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:44.140
better results. And we, I really think we live those values at this

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.280
clinic. We're always trying to provide good care for patients. We're patient

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.680
centered. We're low barrier. We understand that this is

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.220
a population who struggle with equities and we try and narrow that gap.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.400
I think what makes us unique on the North Shore is we don't

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.280
have all of the resources that Vancouver has.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.880
And I worked in Vancouver community for a long time and

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.940
still have a lot of connections there and see what the care is

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:25.880
like there and it's phenomenal. Just really wrap around support, lots of

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.450
resources. We don't have all of that on the North Shore.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.620
So I think what makes us unique is that we're nimble

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:42.020
and we are innovative. We have a mandate to see people who are

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.140
more vulnerable. They might have social complexities, homelessness,

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.120
poverty, struggles with their social determinants of health.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.960
And sometimes we need to augment services for people. And really checking

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.380
bias, I guess, is maybe what I'm trying to say is a big

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.360
part of what you need to work at a place like this and

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.500
what we really try and instill in people

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.700
when we orient them and bring them on. I mean, we naturally attract

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.960
people who also have that perspective, but I think we cultivate that work

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:26.180
as well. I saw somebody yesterday who is a new patient at our clinic

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.460
and she was here for specifically opioid agonist therapy or

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.420
treatment for her addiction, which is what we do a lot of here.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.260
I met with her and, I mean, obviously the focus of the care

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.460
was on her, her sort of therapeutics around her addiction. But of course

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.220
we got into primary care and her social situation

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.970
and we gave her some hot soup and some granola bars she hadn't

00:03:05.025 --> 00:03:09.800
eaten. She had been homeless last week. And

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.700
this is common. We see most of our patients

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.740
have stories like this. And being new to the Lower Mainland,

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.080
she said that she hadn't experienced anything like that before and

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.300
was feeling really safe and really thankful and expressing gratitude at

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.180
having that. And I thought, oh, this is just what we do here.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.680
I have a bunch of people on my panel who I'm MRP for,

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.380
who I've known for years. I've been here for just about five years

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.240
and I've seen them go through lots of their ups and downs,

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.060
but really seeing people stabilized once they're connected to the clinic.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.920
People who use substances and are vulnerable, they intersect in all areas

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:58.040
of healthcare. And so whether you're working in acute services, hospital

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.320
based services, in the community, in public health, in primary care,

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.940
in mental health and substance use, we have such a privilege

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.400
to be working here and doing this work that we do.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:17.680
And with that privilege comes responsibility to take care of people and

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:21.320
be mindful and to challenge our beliefs and

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.320
strive for being a learner and for having an open mind

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.740
and knowing that we're in a really large, complex healthcare system,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.400
but that the work we do is so important

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.580
and it impacts people's lives so much every time they have

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.722
connection with the healthcare system. We really do have a flattened hierarchy.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.380
So everybody at the clinic, whether you are

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.060
a medical provider, you're working at the front desk in your administration,

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:03.680
you're a peer support worker, we all work together for our patients and

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:05.780
we put our patients at the center and I really think

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.500
we do a good job of that.
