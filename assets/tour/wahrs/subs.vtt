the pepika sees nation in saskatchewan

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.599
i am a cree woman and i was brought up

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.000
in

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.759
saskatchewan and now i make my home here

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.039
i'm a visitor

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:19.439
and happy to be here wars is

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.320
pure driven our mission is to improve

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.240
the life of

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.240
aboriginal people who have used and are

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.920
using illicit drugs and alcohol

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:31.679
through education harm reduction

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.079
and outreach and advocacy for our people

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.960
mostly we go into the streets and areas

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.840
where

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.280
a lot of people don't go and we take

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.440
pride in the fact that we do

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.480
all the cleanup jobs that other places

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.200
will not do

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.520
or perhaps maybe don't want to look at

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.160
but

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.399
that's what we do we go right in and we

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.239
talk with the people

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.000
wherever we can in the downtown eastside

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.920
the alleys the corners

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.600
as long as it's on the street that's

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.680
where we are

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.720
the addiction is just the symptom

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.479
of something else that's wrong

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:10.960
pain trauma colonization

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.799
big one there if you look at those

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.240
things first

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.600
then you won't have to look at the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.280
addiction because you'll just know that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.240
it's hand in hand

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.840
so i think it's treat the person first

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.000
the addiction is just the symptom of

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.000
something else that's gone really wrong

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.439
and i think if we start paying attention

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.360
more to that

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.040
to that human being because that person

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.680
wasn't born that way that person didn't

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.600
ask

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.000
when they were five years old to be a

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.720
heroin addict on the downtown east side

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.759
or to be turning tricks at 13 years old

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.280
or what have you

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.360
they didn't ask for that life we were

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.040
not born like that there's a human being

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.479
there and if we can see that beautiful

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.200
human being

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:53.600
right at the crux of where they are the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.600
rest is just the outside it's the shell
