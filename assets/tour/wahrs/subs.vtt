My name is Tracy Draper and I am from the Peepeekisis Nation in

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.920
Saskatchewan. I am a Cree woman and I was brought up in

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.240
Saskatchewan and now I make my home here. I'm a visitor and happy

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.780
to be here. WARS is peer driven. Our mission is to improve the

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.440
life of Aboriginal people who have used and are using illicit drugs and

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:30.940
alcohol through education, harm reduction, and outreach and advocacy for

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.420
our people. Mostly we go into the streets and areas where a lot

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.100
of people don't go and we take pride in the fact that we

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.940
do all the clean up jobs that other places will not do or

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.560
perhaps maybe don't want to look at but that's what we do.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.220
We go right in and we talk with the people

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.920
wherever we can in the downtown east side, the alleys, the corners,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.760
as long as it's on the street, that's where we are.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.840
The addiction is just the symptom of something else that's wrong.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:11.900
Pain, trauma, colonization, big one there. If you look at those things first

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.600
then you won't have to look at the addiction because you'll just know

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.080
that it's hand in hand. So I think it's treat the person first.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.680
The addiction is just the symptom of something else that's gone really wrong.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.960
And I think if we start paying attention more to that, to that

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.160
human being, because that person wasn't born that way, that person didn't

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.760
ask when they were five years old to be a heroin addict on

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.900
the downtown east side or to be turning tricks at 13 years old

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.680
or what have you. They didn't ask for that life. We were not

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.500
born like that. There's a human being there and if we can see

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.340
that beautiful human being right at the crux of where they are,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.400
the rest is just the outside, it's a shell.
