00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.560
My one piece of advice would be to listen.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.040
To listen to what folks are telling you. They know themselves,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.200
they are the experts in their own experience in the healthcare system.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.340
They have already likely faced stigma in the healthcare system and if somebody's

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.920
coming to you because they have a concern, if they're coming to you

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:25.300
and willing to talk to you about those things and open up to

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.480
you, that means that they need something and it's our role to be

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.260
able to step in and create a safe space for folks to be

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.080
able to talk about those things and address their concerns in a way

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.700
that's going to work for them. So my number one thing would be

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.510
to listen. When people are stigmatized, they tend to be treated poorly like

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.960
with whether they're addicted to drugs, if they're homeless, they feel that

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.700
people look down on them and it makes it harder for them to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.520
get care in any sort of setting because

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.410
in so many ways, they're just treated horribly so then they don't want to

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.600
go back to the hospital. So there's a variety of different folks in

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.360
the community that are accessing Insite because it's a safe consumption

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.380
site, the people that are here are folks that are using drugs so

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.500
the majority of the folks that access our site

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.570
use injection drugs and that's a variety of different substances. Insite's

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:19.180
main mission is to meet people where they're at regardless of any sort

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.560
of like mental illness, physical problems, drug addiction, criminal history.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.680
Folks are coming in to have a safe site to inject at a

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.940
safe space to do that, a place where they can be asking questions

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:37.120
and talking to nursing staff. It's managed between the Portland Hotel Society

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.740
and Vancouver Coastal Health. Obviously, we are an overdose prevention site.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.320
People come here to use. They can get their drugs tested here.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.820
We also have nursing services that people can access

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.280
for a lot of care that they, like if they're not able to

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.420
go to other clinics and stuff like that due to stigma or if

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.840
they're just uncomfortable going to the hospital. We also have a detox centre

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.980
upstairs. We do a lot of education about ways that folks can prevent

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.620
overdose or if they've had an overdose talking about those aftercare things

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.320
and being able to monitor and making sure folks have the tools that

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:12.460
they need in the future so that they can be protecting themselves and

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.621
take care of the people around them. They're scared to get this sort of,

00:02:15.647 --> 00:02:18.720
like any sort of treatment. They feel shameful about themselves and they

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.420
feel that they almost deserve nothing. For nursing care at the site,

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.340
we see folks, so we talk about safer injecting practices, so looking at

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.500
ways that people can prevent infection. So how important it is to be

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.360
swabbing your skin every single time you poke, how important it is to

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.560
be changing your rig so that it's not a dull needle that you're

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.520
putting into your skin. At the site, we also do some other basic

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.380
healthcare stuff. So we have a treatment room, which is great because we're

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:50.820
able to do some basic wound care for folks. We also have nurses

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.860
that are STI certified at the site. So we can do STI testing

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.720
and treatment. We have nurses that are certified to do the HIV point

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.840
of care testing and treatment, which is really great. So somewhere like

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.160
Insite, we treat people with like a normal human being, which is how

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.480
any person should be treated regardless of their situation.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.480
Stigma, it makes everyone's life harder where our whole goal is like in

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.960
harm reduction is to just give people the care they deserve.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.820
Everyone in the world deserves to be cared for. When I first started

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.920
at Insite, I was blown away by the sense of community that exists

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.100
in this room. The camaraderie among participants and staff at the site,

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.700
the beautiful relationships and really good environment that exists in here.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.580
So it was just really cool coming from a different healthcare setting to

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.160
be able to see that sense of community and the way that people

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.980
can talk about things so frankly and openly, whereas in so many other

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.420
environments, people feel like they have to hide their drug use.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.780
So that was just really cool to see that sense of community here.
