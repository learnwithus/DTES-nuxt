WEBVTT

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.960
I think as healthcare providers we need to take that initiative

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.000
to push the boundaries. The Anne Vogel Clinic is

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.080
a clinic primarily for folks with opioid use disorder. We have multiple

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.240
doctors on our team, medical providers, we also have some nurse practitioners

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:27.600
and they all do opioid agonist therapy prescribing, or some people call

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.800
OAT or O R T, Opioid Replacement Therapy.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.180
And then there are a few of us allied health. There are two

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.520
part time social workers, I'm one of them. There's a

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.380
registered clinical counselor and there's also a full time outreach worker

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.820
which has been a new addition to the clinic over the last year

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.140
and that has been really, really helpful. Everyone has noticed at the clinic

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.820
that more people are engaged, more people are coming to appointments.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.120
We have someone on the ground in the community maintaining those really

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.760
important relationships. We do you know various forms of trauma, grief,

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.700
counseling, substance use counseling. We specifically work with Richmond

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.860
residents. We're harm reduction as well so we have a lot of harm

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.520
reduction supplies. It's really client led and we try to meet people where

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.940
they're at and let them lead their journey.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.860
We serve people who are living in the modular housing buildings,

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.380
the temporary modulars, the emergency response center shelter, the Salvation

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.940
Army, shelter Richmond House and people who are also working full time and

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.740
have a past history of opioid use disorder. But from what I'm gathering

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.260
from speaking with clients at the clinic and as I get to know

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.280
everybody, they feel really welcomed to come into the clinic.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.300
They know that they get solid advocacy and now outreach services

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.040
from us and then in terms of stigma

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.980
and anti stigma work, what else can we do to make this a

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:18.760
more welcoming, decolonizing, less institutional place where people feel

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.260
comfortable coming in and getting their needs met and getting services that

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:30.040
they require. We don't want to be punishing

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.320
people for using. I think we've seen many many times that that approach

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.540
doesn't work and we are just trying to increase

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.720
feelings of safety, establish that relationship and keep inviting people

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.200
back. I think one of the big things we can do is language.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.280
Watch our language and be mindful of our language. Did someone have a

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.580
clean urine? How much clean time? What is the opposite of that?

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.100
It's dirty and so are we saying people who aren't clean are dirty?

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:11.360
Drug addict. Let's use people centered and person first language. So a person

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.300
who uses substances, a person who uses drugs. I've had first hand experience

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.860
accompanying countless clients to emergency departments, interacting with

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:28.010
paramedics in hospital rooms, the hospital system and community health care

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:34.280
systems as well and it makes such a difference if someone feels validated,

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.740
supported, dignified, treated with respect and dignity as opposed to

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.080
being spoken about in the third person. I've had health care workers address

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.360
me as opposed to the client when we're in the same room together

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.920
and I always say why don't you ask them?

00:03:52.440 --> 00:04:03.620
They're right here. I think we have some really great people on mental

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.020
health and substance use teams right now who

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.780
I'm speaking with and who seem so committed

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.620
to doing anti stigma work, anti racism work, decolonial work

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.240
and really walking the walk and not just giving lip service to it.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.360
Richmond can be a somewhat conservative community. I have confidence in

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.020
the Vancouver Coastal teams and who's leading them right now and I think

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.560
as long as we keep the communication, lines of communication open,

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.500
we will continue to push the envelope for equitable,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:48.840
safe, trauma informed care that our patients in Richmond need and deserve.
