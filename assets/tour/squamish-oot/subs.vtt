00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.280
I think I'd really like for healthcare providers to know that every interaction

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.880
they have with people who use substances will influence whether they

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.860
feel safe seeking care in the future. And that's something that I see

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.800
a lot in my work is that people will be reluctant to

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.200
seek care for really basic things, because they've been treated poorly in

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.740
the past. Yeah, so we offer quite a few different programs and services.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.940
Most important for the clients, that I work with, would be

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.980
the intensive case management team. We have an OAT clinic as well,

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.280
so for folks that are looking to get on methadone, Suboxone,

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.360
KD, and that kind of thing. We've got a psychiatry service that we

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.500
refer to as well, and we also work closely with the local shelters,

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.520
really just ensuring that people's basic needs are met and that if they're

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.320
looking for extra support with their mental and physical health, then we

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.480
can offer those things. You know provide a first point of contact for

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.140
folks when they're looking for support and help direct them in whatever

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.940
direction they're looking to go. So whether that is

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.040
basic needs like food and shelter, whether it is mental health support,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.060
we just we meet them where they are.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.160
I think the people that are using services and accessing the services that

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.940
we offer are just members of the community. So you know substance use

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:44.400
is something that exists across the population. One of the struggles that

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.820
we have is there has been a huge influx of people,

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.880
a huge influx of wealth, and there's been a lot of loss of

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.440
space for people and a lot of loss of affordable housing.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.100
It's hard for me to kind of say who the people are because

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:10.280
it really is everybody. I mean, I would really love to see

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.640
healthcare workers working in community settings, working in the hospital,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.960
have access to the information that we have access to and know that

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.740
we're here to help. And I think that sometimes we, because we're in

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.840
different buildings and with COVID, and sometimes we forget that one another

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.900
is... That we're out there. So I would just say

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.320
if folks are working with patients that they

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.900
maybe have questions about or they're not sure, or they're even just looking

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.140
for some guidance, if they're working with someone that's using substances

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.220
like please, please reach out. I'm always happy to drive up to the

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:59.220
hospital or just chat on the phone. When I'm having conversations with other

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.560
service providers, I try to really remind them that

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.440
these are just people and that so many of the people we work

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.400
with also have such complex trauma histories, and

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.480
when they come in asking for our help, that's already taking a tremendous

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.780
amount of courage from them. So I think the very least that we

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.520
can do is treat them with dignity and kindness like we would anyone

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.740
else.
