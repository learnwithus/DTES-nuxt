00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:09.240
I turned into like a devious frightened loner. It's a lot of shame.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:19.272
Shame. My name is Trey and some people call me Ashtray. It's just

00:00:19.354 --> 00:00:22.180
a weird nickname. I don't actually even smoke anymore.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.560
But I am the manager of overdose prevention sites, one of the managers.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.800
We hire drug users from within the community and give them a safe

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.640
way to make money, make sure that no one overdoses.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.500
When I started out using drugs, it was fun and it was

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.880
a way to fit in. I was able to hold it together for

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.920
a while, like a day job. I was married, I had a wife

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.280
and a kid and the house and everything.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:13.480
Eventually all that wasn't really important anymore. There were points

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.775
in that period of my life that I looked like a zombie.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.440
I looked like I could be an extra on the show The Walking

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.280
Dead. When I would get really high on

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.240
crystal meth and heroin, my skin would get itchy and I'd hyperfocus on

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.120
like maybe a zit that I had on my face or

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.140
on my head or my body somewhere, and I just continually pick at

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.540
it until it was a big gaping wound. They wouldn't heal for days.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.430
I would come to the hospital with a legitimate health concern and I would

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.900
get treated as someone who was seeking drugs.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.400
I remember one time when I was inactive of drug use,

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.660
I had been homeless for a certain amount of years. It was freezing,

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.560
it was cold and I was wandering around aimlessly

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.820
for like days pretty much. And I needed a place to rest,

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.280
I didn't have anywhere to go and I figured that

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.821
the hospital would be open. So I wanted to come and warm up

00:02:24.821 --> 00:02:31.440
for a bit. And I came to the emergency room at VGH and

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.160
sat there trying to stay out of the cold for a while.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.980
And I was immediately picked out by a nurse

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.540
as a drug user as someone who was trying to

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.560
come in and stay warm and was told to beat it.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.300
And it hurt and it gets to the point where you get beaten

00:02:52.300 --> 00:03:05.660
down so much, it's like why even bother? Why even bother? I had a

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.240
legitimate hand infection and they told me I needed to rest and take

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.000
it easy and take the antibiotics. I pleaded with

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.060
the doctor and I just explained to him the facts that

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:26.460
the way that I supported myself was frequently breaking into cars

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.620
as a means to find something I could sell quickly for quick bucks. He

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.200
took pity on me and said that he would give me a prescription

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.165
for, I think it was hydromorph. I'm pretty sure it was hydromorph. He gave

00:03:43.207 --> 00:03:46.860
me a dilly script based on my heroin use

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.500
so that I could take it easy and relax. I'll always remember that

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.900
doctor as someone who actually listened to me,

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.600
heard what I was saying, saw past the fact that I was a

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.200
drug user and had empathy towards me, towards my situation and actually

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.120
saw that even though I was living a shady life at the time,

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.400
that if I had the option I wouldn't want to do that.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.800
I came back to the community that I

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.280
know and love so well, the Downtown Eastside, and I wanted to find

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.980
a reason to be there that wasn't using drugs. And there was a

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.780
peer run site called Ops and they hired me

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:37.840
as someone with lived experience. Places like Ops provide

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.280
employment opportunities and training for people like me who

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.840
get stigmatized and have criminal records. I know now that I work

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.700
in the Downtown Eastside helping other people who are in the same situation

00:04:57.739 --> 00:05:00.700
that I was in in my life, I know all too well how

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:08.240
important it is to drop judgments and have low barrier care for someone

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.500
who is facing that situation in their life, and give them hugs and

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.580
look at them in the eyes and ask them what they need,

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.600
ask them how their day is going. That's so important and

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.090
stigma is a big barrier in that.
