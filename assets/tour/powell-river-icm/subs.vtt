00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.860
I don't know how you put someone in a position to

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.220
become more empathetic or compassionate. That's an intrinsic thing. That's

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.680
not something you can just read in a book and you naturally have

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.500
love for someone else, or care for someone else who is struggling.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:35.700
interdisciplinary team with nurses, outreach workers. We get

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.860
support from psychiatry in the hospital as well and we liaison with

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.180
prescribers of the community. We are always advocating for clients in the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.980
emergency department whether that be a certification to

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.620
psychiatry or a medical floor, whatever the case may be.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.940
We work with the individual as through their stay in hospital and try

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.460
to have them land in community as gently as possible upon discharge.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.280
We also have a 44 bed unit. We support

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.560
most of the clients that live in that space.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.040
Previously to that they were either precariously housed or

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:27.760
homeless, visibly homeless in the community. Stigma care is one thing that's

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.340
on the forefront of all my colleagues that work for the intensive case

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.240
management team. Through that we try to use a client centered approach,

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:46.100
a trauma informed approach and to best support our clients and advocate

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.920
on their behalf. It is something that unfortunately

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.900
we do see a lot of in hospital and in community and

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.300
we try to be the advocates for these people who sometimes don't have

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:06.600
a voice in these situations. It's not an easy fix. It's not like

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.620
setting an arm and doing an x ray and putting a cast on

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.620
and you're good in six weeks. This is just, every day is ever

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.160
changing and there is no perfect outcome. So I think that can also

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.360
be overwhelming for people and they get anxious and they just don't know

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.640
how to deal with seeing someone in that situation again and again and

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:39.240
again and again and again. So stigma can happen

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.900
and does happen unfortunately in many different situations and paths I cross

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.900
in my line of work which could range from the community to the

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.240
emergency department. I just recently had a client who was

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.980
new to town, ended up not being able to find any housing and

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.660
ended up at the shelter. She was fleeing a 13 year

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.020
domestic violence relationship, coming up here to try to get some

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.680
space from her ex partner. Due to the nature of her

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.260
alcohol use disorder, she ended up... We ended up doing a wellness check,

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.720
she was semi unconscious in her room. We brought her into the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.860
emergency department, were instantly thrown with why then you... Why isn't

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.060
she in the drunk tank. I try to relate to when that first

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.660
trauma happened, that sort of set things in motion and use that,

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.040
that takes away all stigma because that can happen at

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.760
different ages, different times in their life and I work from that point

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.280
as to when the person first got hurt and how we can now

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.140
build some relationship and try to make things a little bit better,

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.340
just piece by piece.
