00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.280
You know, you're driving down a street and you get the address and

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.380
you stop at a house and it's in a beautiful neighbourhood and you

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.980
walk into the house and it's like an SRO on the downtown east side.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.400
Working on the North Shore is, I love it. It's amazing because it's

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.820
such a diverse population that I'm working with. I've worked in the downtown

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.420
east side prior for multiple years and the North Shore is my home

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.220
and I had an opportunity to work here.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.240
The people that I work with really vary. They can be

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:47.080
people that are working five days a week, raising families, people that

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.520
live in big mansions in the British properties or people that are living

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.520
in a homeless camp. The majority of my referrals come from Lionsgate Hospital

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.960
Emergency Department when people have presented with an overdose or somebody

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.580
presents and is really high risk for overdose due to substances that they're

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:08.160
using. When I first phone people or first meet people, some people are,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.420
they feel ashamed right away. They're like, oh no,

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.380
how was I referred to you? And they're scared and they feel like

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.920
I'm going to judge them. So I have to spit out my spiel really,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.640
really fast so that I can keep them on the phone or keep

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.860
them engaged. One of the first things I say is I'm not here

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.980
to tell you what to do. I'm here to honour where you're at

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.200
in your journey and support you and I can support you in any

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.540
way that you need. My mandate is to connect people to care,

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.040
but for different people that looks very different.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.660
For some people that is connecting them to counseling or

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.500
for some people that's connecting them to detox and treatment, other people

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.480
need a primary care clinic or access to OAT, which is opiate agonist therapy.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.750
And some people just want some harm reduction education and access to an

00:01:56.065 --> 00:02:02.280
aloxone kit. My mandate is to connect people to services and we're so

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.500
restricted with services. And there's a lot of people that don't want to

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.960
acknowledge that there is addiction on the North Shore, that there's addiction

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.540
on almost every street on the North Shore. And it's so stigmatized and

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.520
it's much more behind closed doors. I was really quite blown away myself.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.740
I've been a resident in the North Shore for 15 years.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.715
I work with a lot of partners on the North Shore,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.140
but some of the services that I feel should be designed for people

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.480
who use substances, they say we'll call back when they're not using anymore.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:46.960
And that's not really useful. Stigma has a really huge impact on clients

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.000
that I work with. I've noticed sometimes a client would

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.040
reach out to a care provider, whether that's a doctor or a hospital

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.840
or a primary care clinic or somewhere, because they're feeling dope sick,

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.740
for example, and they're not treated with care and respect always.

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.800
Their symptoms aren't treated. They're told, go sleep it off, go have a

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.120
sandwich. But if their symptoms weren't related to substance use, they would

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.400
be treated for their symptoms. We need to

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.060
treat people with dignity and respect and compassion,

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.100
no matter where they're at in their journey with addiction or substance

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.880
use. When I first started working on the North Shore, I was based

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.140
out of stepping stones. And I do personally have lived and living experience.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.940
And I remember I was just, I was sitting in the waiting room

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.460
there and there was this crickety little locker thing in the corner and

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.160
I went to open it and it made this really loud creaking sound

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.880
and it's a really quiet office space. And I was like,

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.000
what is in this thing? And it was harm reduction supplies that were

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.920
in there. And I just imagine myself as a patient of the clinic

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.740
wanting to access those harm reduction supplies, but not wanting people

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.260
to know I was accessing harm reduction supplies, because I know at times

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.400
in my own addiction, I didn't want to be honest about where I

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.920
was at with my using. And I just kind of pictured myself like sneaking

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.380
over the cupboard, but not making it make noise. And I brought it

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.200
to the team there and now they have

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.140
a display shelf with much more accessible harm reduction supplies. And I

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.500
thought that was a great way that they address stigma there. If we

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.180
really want to address stigma, we can't beat around the bush about it,

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.200
right? Like we've got to be really upfront and honest and point out

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.980
the flaws in the system and where things aren't working. Then we can

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.060
actually provide some change, right? And you know, harm reduction philosophy

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.060
is, it is newer, but we need to get it out there because

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.320
it's working. And in a time when so many people are dying,

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.880
we've got to do whatever we can do. And I just hope people

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.020
are open to learning more about reducing stigma and

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.340
becoming less ignorant in a sense.
