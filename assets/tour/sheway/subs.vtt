00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.100
If they're in an unsafe place, they know that. They don't want to put

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.060
their children at risk, but how do we keep them involved in their children's

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.500
lives? Because if we don't, their children are going to be looking for

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.880
them in the downtown Eastside in 20 years and end up down here

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:21.820
themselves. So the mandate for Sheways provides low barrier care to women

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.580
from a harm reduction, trauma informed, culturally safe viewpoint.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.540
The women have used substances and are pregnant and are parenting,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.100
living in the downtown Eastside or in Vancouver and frequenting in the downtown

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.140
Eastside. We provide services until they are at a place where they can

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.600
move on and access other services, usually around the time when a child

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.800
is three years old. We provide as much care as possible under one

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.340
roof so they don't get lost between systems. Approximately 70% of our clients

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.180
self identify as Indigenous. I think that a lot of our clients,

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.140
when trying to access care, come in contact with people that have no

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.600
or very little experience treating people who use substances with respect

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.620
and that can be a huge barrier for people to continue to engage

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.920
in care. Most of the women that I've worked with over the last

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.720
27 years have loved their children and they've cared for their children

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.240
and their children want to be involved with them.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.500
We need to look as a society in a different way of how

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:37.240
to support that. For instance, sometimes we'll have a pregnant woman who

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.560
we only have one or two chances to get to the hospital for

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.600
an ultrasound and if their experience there isn't good, they may leave before

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.600
their ultrasound is done or they may never engage in care again. Many

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.940
of the women that we see that identify as Indigenous are here because

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.620
they are over represented in so many of the

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.120
stigmatized parts of our society. They're over represented in poverty and

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.980
the broader determinants of health. They're much more likely to be involved

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:16.320
in negative experiences. They often haven't been raised by their family

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.940
members and so have experienced a lot of

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.820
damage through the different systems of care that they've accessed whether

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:27.720
that be child welfare or medical systems. It's not uncommon for many of

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.540
our clients to not know who their family members are.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.140
A lot of what their journey and healing encompasses has included re engaging

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.220
with cultural practices and traditional healing, becoming proud of who they

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:50.180
are and not ashamed. I think a lot of our clients have had

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.680
negative experiences in the past engaging in health care or social services.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.060
So I think oftentimes when we come into their lives there can be

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.940
a lot of resistance. And I think that

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.660
as health care professionals the onus is on us to build that relationship

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:16.140
and to not take those things personally. For instance, in my practice I've

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.740
actually found that when someone tells you to f off, that's a huge

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.580
opportunity to build a relationship and to address

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.860
how that person actually wants to be approached.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.440
And I think some of the best relationships I've actually built with some

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.760
of the clients that I have the best relationships with were after

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.320
they told me to f off and we turned that around and had

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.600
a really good conversation about what they actually

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.420
want from us and for their care.
