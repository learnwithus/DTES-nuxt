The Downtown Eastside is a multicultural community, with many residents

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.640
connected to culturally diverse communities and histories, including the

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.960
Chinatown district as well as the histories of Japanese residents in Oppenheimer

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.060
prior to World War II and the devastation of the internment camps.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.660
While the community is located on the Coast Salish territories, the Downtown

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.040
Eastside includes Indigenous people from across North America. The community

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.120
is often recognized for poverty, homelessness and substance use. However,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.720
the Downtown Eastside also needs to be acknowledged for its multicultural,

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.000
interconnected communities that truly care for each other.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.480
There are several community organizations in the Downtown Eastside that

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.680
are doing extraordinary work in providing essential services to the community.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.780
This project provides a tour of some of the community based services in

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.700
the Downtown Eastside and shares video interviews with community members

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:07.960
who have been impacted by stigma when accessing health care. During your

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.700
tour, please reflect on the following questions. Do these stories impact

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.920
your perspective of the overdose crisis, substance use in the community

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.060
of the Downtown Eastside? How does learning about the lived experience of

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.640
community members in the Downtown Eastside impact our practices in health

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.640
care?
