00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:05.700
Thank you for exploring this area of Vancouver with us. Before you go,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.000
here are a few questions to ask yourself.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.980
Did these stories impact your perspective of the overdose crisis, substance

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:17.480
use, and the community of the Downtown Eastside? Did you notice anything

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.380
that you can change in your practice after learning more about the stigma

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.780
in this community? Have you witnessed or experienced stigma in healthcare,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.100
like the examples described in these interviews? How will you approach a

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.020
situation when you've witnessed a stigmatizing interaction or a conversation

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.800
from a colleague? Do the policies at your workplace perpetuate stigma against

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.580
those who use substances? Are there policies and practices that support

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.140
access for people who are using substances? What would you like to share

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.500
with other healthcare providers about the impacts of stigma?

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.940
Would you recommend this course for your colleagues as a learning tool to

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.520
improve interactions and engagement with client care?
