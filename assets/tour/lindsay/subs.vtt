00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.560
I had a tough time dealing with going to the hospital and then

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:15.220
treated like garbage, right? Because I was an addict at the time.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.160
I was a hard sell at the very beginning, I think,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:27.080
where most people are. But once I figured out that they're there to

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.360
help me, I just embraced the knowledge that they could share.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.620
The minute they see your chart with your history that you're a drug

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.800
addict or you're this or you're an alcoholic, right away you're put in

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.200
this file. The nurse that was helping me, to this day I remember

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.580
because I was PO'd, like they thought I was coming in and I

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.400
was high and stuff, but I wasn't. I was in there to get

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:13.660
help, because I needed help. My mental health care worker, Zoe, I didn't

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.220
like her at the beginning. She called me out on my shit and

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.240
I did not like her when I first met her, but now I love her. She didn't

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.580
judge me, which is a huge thing. You know I couldn't ask for

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:36.860
anybody better than Zoe. I would say probably

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:55.540
rekindling my relationship with my daughter. Treat others as you would like

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.220
to be treated would be a big one.
