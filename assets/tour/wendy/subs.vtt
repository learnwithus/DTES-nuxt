People use drugs. It's not a moral shortcoming. It's not a moral deficiency.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.240
It's not lazy or stupid. I don't know any lazy

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:16.420
drug users. My name is Wendy Stevens. I am currently the Peer Operations

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.720
Coordinator with Vancouver Coastal Health's Overdose Emergency Response

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.940
Team. I do a lot of educational work with healthcare professionals and also

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.860
with peers working in the Downtown Eastside. I'm a former drug user and

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:35.650
sex trade worker. I wish people could just for a minute

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.560
look past what they see on the surface of someone.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:48.840
Someone who might be dirty and, you know, shooting up in their back

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.820
alley or sleeping in their doorway and just realize that that person,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.940
probably that person doesn't want that for themselves and there's a lot

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.880
of things that put that person there. I had a very bad infection

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.600
on my arm. The infection was getting really bad. I was getting really

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.360
sick from it. So one of the organizations downtown that

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.000
I was a member of, they put me in a cab.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.580
They told the cab not to let me out until we got to

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.600
the hospital and he didn't. So I went into emergency and I was

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.940
in a lot of pain and I was not in a good place.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.560
I was not well, 100% ready to be treated like crap.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.360
The doctor came in and I was in a lot of pain.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.860
They hadn't given me anything for pain and I was crying and

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.420
I remember he had an intern with him and I remember he said,

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.700
"You know, if you think this is unpleasant for you, how do you

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.180
think we feel having to see people like you every day?"

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.540
And he leaned over and he said, "If you don't shut up right

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.420
now, I'm not giving you anything for pain."

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:06.220
I find it frustrating when people won't even try to understand

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.220
what poverty is, what being physically and emotionally dependent on a substance

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.040
to get through a day, not even to get high, but just to

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.740
get through a day. The start of a conversation might be safe supply.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.920
What do you need? Part of that, giving people what they need,

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.380
for me, goes hand in hand with dignity.

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.460
There's nothing dignified about ingesting hand sanitizer because your body

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.648
needs alcohol. People with diabetes, you know, I don't think anyone's going

00:02:43.675 --> 00:02:47.680
to judge that person for eating a Snickers bar

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.920
the way we judge people for using substances.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:59.040
And some people need something because of pain, physical pain, emotional

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.500
pain, and we've all had it. I spent many, many years

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.700
not liking myself enough to make sure that my body had food or

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.420
a place to sleep or a shower or anything really. I just,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.160
I assumed my entire life would be in that

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.680
four or five block radius of Hastings that was

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.080
the world. I remember thinking that if I could use all of

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.620
the knowledge and experience that I had from that part of my life

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.700
to help other people get better health care and help people be able

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.060
to give better health care, if I could do that, then all of

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.720
my time out there wouldn't be for nothing.
