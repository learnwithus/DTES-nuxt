### Congratulations, you've finished the course!

Before you go, here are a few questions to ask yourself:

- Did these stories impact your perspective on the overdose crisis, substance use, and community of the downtown east side?
- Did you notice anything that you can change in your practice after learning more about stigma in this community?
- Have you witnessed, or experienced, stigma in healthcare like the examples described in the interviews?
- How will you approach a situation when youâ€™ve witnessed a stigmatizing interaction or conversation from a colleague?
- Do the policies at your workplace perpetuate stigma against people who use substances? Are there policies and practices that support access for people who use substances?
- What would you like to share with other healthcare providers about the impacts of stigma?
- Would you recommend this course for your colleagues as a learning tool to improve interactions and engagement with client care?

Thank you for exploring with us.
