### Congratulations, you're finished the course!

Before you go, here a a few questions to ask yourself:

-	Did the stories that you heard impact your perspective on homelessness, poverty, substance use, and mental health?
-	Is there anything you will change in your practice after learning about stigma?
-	Have you witnessed, or experienced, stigma in healthcare like the examples described in the interviews?
-	How will you approach a situation when youâ€™ve witnessed a stigmatizing interaction or conversation from a colleague?
-	Do the policies at your workplace perpetuate stigma against people who use substances? Are there policies and practices that support access for people who use substances?
-	What would you like to share with other healthcare providers about the impacts of stigma?
-	Would you recommend this course for your colleagues as a learning tool to improve interactions and engagement with client care?

Thank you for exploring with us.
