bio: Brandon was born in Richmond. He is currently three and a half years in recovery from multiple different addictions throughout many years. He used to play soccer at a highly competitive level and has also coached youth soccer in Richmond for over ten years. The reason he is involved in stigma work is because he knows many people who have lost their life and had negative experience with health care providers. So if he can help change the way health care providers treat people with substance use and mental health when accessing health care.
