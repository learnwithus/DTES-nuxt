      description: Wendy Stevens is the Peer Operations Coordinator with Vancouver Coastal Health’s Overdose Emergency Response Team.  Before coming to work with VCH, she worked in HIV healthcare, education and support. Wendy has many years of lived experience with addiction, sex trade and life in the Downtown Eastside.  Wendy has been off of street drugs for almost 10 years and is on a replacement treatment. She’s truly grateful that she’s able to stay connected to the DTES community through her work with VCH.
