**Stigma** comes from the Greek word 'mark/puncture'. Stigma can be defined as attitudes, behaviours, structures and/or beliefs that are prejudicial towards a group or individual based on life circumstance. 

Based on our own personal experiences, cultural and racial backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, and other elements that make up our identities, we experience different types of stigmas in different ways. Stigma can be experienced individually, socially, and structurally: when we become stigmatized by these external sources, we can, in turn, internalize stigma.
