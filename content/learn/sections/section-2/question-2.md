<!--- This is where question-level feedback goes -->

Majority of people (~65%) had no contact with police in past two years
- Those that did have contact were mostly for minor offenses (shoplifting, breach of probation)

Highest number of overdoses are occurring with individuals using alone and using in their place of residence
