<!--- This is where question-level feedback goes -->

Based on our own personal experiences, cultural and racial backgrounds, socioeconomic statuses, and other elements that make up our identities, we experience different types of stigmas in different ways. Stigma can be experienced individually, socially, and structurally: when we become stigmatized by these external sources, we can, in turn, internalize stigma. 

**Stigma** comes from the Greek word "mark" or "puncture", and hence stigma can be experienced as a type of mark leading to mistreatment or othering. An example of this would be a person that uses substances being denied medical care, because of the stigma from health professionals, associated with their substance use.
