<!--- This is where question-level feedback goes -->
Stigma is recognised as an underlying factor of the opioid crisis in Canada.

Stigma undermines the effectiveness of the response to the BC overdose crisis:
- Creates barriers to individuals who want to receive or access basic healthcare and social needs.
- Compromises the quality of care provided and/or received when an individual is treated.
- Negatively influences public support and political will for evidence-based strategies and project funding.
