Stigma may manifest in overt judgement or hostility, or through tacit/non-verbal practices such as excessive use of hygiene/infection control, increased wait times, lack of on-site facilities for substance use (i.e. overdose prevention services), or refusal of service based on ongoing drug use.

Stigma can be defined as attitudes, behaviours, structures and/or beliefs that are prejudicial towards a group or individual based on life circumstance. The social process of stigma reinforces power and control roles and leads to discrimination, denial of services and loss of status for those that are stigmatized.
