<!--- This is where the rich feedback goes -->
Stigma undermines the effectiveness of the response to the BC overdose crisis by:
- Creating barriers to individuals who want to receive or access basic healthcare and social needs
- Compromising the quality of care provided and/or received when an individual is treated
- Influencing public support for evidence-based strategies and project funding
