### Stigmatization of PWUS occurs in many ways:
- The labels we apply to people who use substances (PWUS) are unhelpful, reduce people to one aspect of their life, and fail to capture the root causes and meaning of substance use  for different people at different times in their lives, treating only the symptoms, rather than what’s behind the symptoms. This is compounded by prohibition and criminalization of the use of drugs, as it is more difficult to empathize or understand substance use when it is illegal.
- Unjust societal stigmatization and stereotypes of PWUS as violent or criminal leads to social exclusion, barriers to service, and internalized stigma.
- The prohibition model we currently have restricts PWUS from either accessing healthcare or remaining in a healthcare setting if placed in a position where they are forced to abstain while in care. It also restricts healthcare providers from offering the options, services and supports that PWUS need to safely access care. This negatively impacts a person’s health and wellbeing.
