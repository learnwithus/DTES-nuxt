- Feelings of shame and isolation caused by social stigma and stigmatizing language may exacerbate substance use complications and consequences where individuals may conceal substance use, use alone, be less likely to attend harm reduction programs, or seek treatment.
- Those experiencing stigma while seeking care are less likely to return for further care. Unfortunately PWUDs report health care as a major setting of stigma and discrimination, with one survey finding that 80% reported health care discrimination. 
- Studies have shown widespread stigmatization of people who use drugs by staff in healthcare settings, with settings with the lowest contact with PWUS often displaying greater negative beliefs and attitudes.
