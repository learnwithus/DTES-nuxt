<!--- This is where the rich feedback goes -->
**A recent study** surveyed 261 PWUS in Vancouver. 52% did not disclose their substance use to their providers. Those who did disclose reported reduced quality of care (Pearce et al., 2020).

**Discrimination by healthcare workers** can act as a barrier to healthcare for those that are stigmatized, including an increase in discharges of PWUS against medical advice, and impacts to accessing future care. These discriminations may manifest in overt judgement or hostility, or through tacit/non-verbal practises such as excessive use of hygiene/infection control, increased wait times, lack of on-site facilities for substance use

**PWUS** report health care as a major setting of stigma and discrimination, with one survey finding that 80% reported health care discrimination.
