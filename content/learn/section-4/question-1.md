### Stigmatization of people who use drugs occurs in many ways:
- The labels applied to people who use substances (PWUS) is unhelpful and fails to capture the root cause of someone’s usage. Instead this perpetuates a treatment of only the symptoms. This is compounded by prohibition and criminalization of the use of drugs.
- Societal stigmatization of PWUS as violent or criminal leads to social exclusion, barriers to service, and internalized stigma.
- The prohibition model restricts PWUS from either accessing healthcare or remaining in a healthcare setting if placed in a position where they are forced to abstain while in care. This negatively impacts a person’s health and wellbeing.
