<!--- This is where the rich feedback goes -->
Stigma undermines the effectiveness of the response to the BC overdose crisis:
- Creates barriers to individuals who need to receive or access basic healthcare and social needs.
- Compromises the quality of care provided and/or received when an individual is treated.
- Influences public support for evidence-based strategies and project funding.
