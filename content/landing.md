People who use substances (PWUS) and people living in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside (DTES) are often stigmatized and labelled with negative stereotypes, including within the healthcare system. The goal of the project is to help decrease stigma in healthcare, enhance providers’ understanding of the community and build healthcare providers’ skills and confidence working with clients from the DTES.

### THERE ARE 2 PARTS
1. **Learn** - A course to allow healthcare providers to better understand the lives of their patients, to provide culturally safe practice, and to increase access to care and quality of care for people who use substances.
2. **Tour** - A virtual tour exploring some community-based services in the DTES with interviews of community members who have been impacted by stigma.
