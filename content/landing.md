People who use substances (PWUS) and people living in Vancouverâ€™s Downtown Eastside (DTES) are often stigmatized and labelled with negative stereotypes, including within the healthcare system. Stigma and discrimination can prevent people from seeking care, leading to poor quality of care, exacerbation of existing health condition, and further mistrust of the healthcare system. Stigma and discrimination also may uphold rules and policies that exclude and marginalize people who need and deserve good care.

### THERE ARE 2 PARTS

2. **Tour** - An interactive documentary introducing the concept of stigma in the context of the overdose crisis. We focus on our partnerships PWUS in the DTES as this community faces multiple types of stigma
