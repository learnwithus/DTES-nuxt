Discrimination by healthcare workers can act as a barrier to healthcare for those that are stigmatized including increased discharges against medical advice, and access to future care. These discriminations might manifest in overt judgement or hostility or through practises such as excessive use of hygiene/infection control, increased wait times, lack of provisioning of on-site usage facilities, or refusal of service based on ongoing drug use.
