## Purpose of the Project
People who use substances (PWUS) and people living in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside (DTES) are often stigmatized and labelled with negative stereotypes, including within the healthcare system. Stigma and discrimination can prevent people from seeking care, leading to poor quality of care, exacerbation of existing health condition, and further mistrust of the healthcare system. Stigma and discrimination also may uphold rules and policies that exclude and marginalize people who need and deserve good care. 

The goal of the project is to help decrease stigma in healthcare, enhance providers’ understanding of the community and build healthcare providers’ skills and confidence working with clients from the DTES. The project provides a virtual tour of some of the community-based services in the DTES, and shares video interviews with community members who have been impacted by stigma. The objective of the course is to allow healthcare providers to better understand the lives of their patients, to provide culturally safe practice, and to increase access to care and quality of care for people who use substances. The goal is for this education is reducing social and structural stigma in health care, improve health care access, and ultimately reduce the toll of the overdose public health emergency.
