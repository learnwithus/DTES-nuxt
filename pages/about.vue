        The community of the DTES is multi-cultural, with many residents
        connected to culturally diverse communities and histories, including the
        Chinatown district, as well the histories of Japanese residents in
        Oppenheimer, prior to World War II and the devastation of the internment
        camps. While the community is located on Coast Salish territories, the
        DTES has a higher proportion of Indigenous people than other communities
        within Vancouver, and includes Indigenous people from across North
        America. While recognized for poverty, homelessness, substance use, the
        DTES also needs to be acknowledged for their multi-cultural,
        inter-connected communities that care for each other.
